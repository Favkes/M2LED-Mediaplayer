## **About**
M2LED is an open-source software project aiming at 
allowing simple and explicit control over 
LED-Strip controlling software.


## **Execution**
To run the program, simply open `run.bat` .


## **Intents**
My main goal in the development of this project,
is creating an intermediate, comprehensible example
of how someone just beginning their software development
journey - with little to no experience -
might structure their projects, especially
(but not exclusively) those written in the
Python programming language.

After all, this is my own humble attempt at
learning the way, as well.

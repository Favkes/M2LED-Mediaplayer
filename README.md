## **About**
M2LED is an open-source software project aiming at 
allowing simple and explicit control over 
LED-Strip controlling software.


## **Setup (Linux-exclusive)**
Make sure your user is in the `dialout` group to access serial ports without sudo:
```bash
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
```


## **Execution**

### **Windows**
To run the program, simply open `run.bat` .

### **Linux**
To run the program, simply open `run.sh`.


## **Intents**
My main goal in the development of this project,
is creating an intermediate, comprehensible example
of how someone just beginning their software development
journey - with little to no experience -
might structure their projects, especially
(but not exclusively) those written in the
Python programming language.

_After all, this is my own humble attempt at
learning the way, as well._
